Disease: diabetes mellitus (disease)

Entity: Chronic kidney disease, Stage I
Reason: Chronic kidney disease is a major long-term complication of diabetes mellitus due to diabetic nephropathy.
Path (similar (score=0.962)): Stage 1 chronic kidney disease (node) → phenotype_phenotype (edge) → Chronic kidney disease (node) → disease_phenotype_positive (edge) → Alstrom syndrome (node) → disease_disease (edge) → diabetes mellitus (disease) (node)

Entity: Background diabetic retinopathy
Reason: This is a classic microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus affecting the retina and is directly linked to chronic hyperglycemia.
Path (exact (case-insensitive)): background diabetic retinopathy (node) → disease_disease (edge) → diabetic retinopathy (node) → off-label use (edge) → Lisinopril (node) → contraindication (edge) → diabetes mellitus (disease) (node)

Entity: Proteinuria
Reason: Proteinuria is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy, reflecting kidney damage in diabetic patients.
Path (exact): Proteinuria (node) → drug_effect (edge) → Fosinopril (node) → contraindication (edge) → diabetes mellitus (disease) (node)

Entity: Renal failure, unspecified
Reason: End-stage renal disease often develops as a consequence of long-standing uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

Entity: Obesity, unspecified
Reason: Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for type II diabetes mellitus, contributing to insulin resistance.

Entity: Malignant essential hypertension
Reason: Hypertension frequently coexists with diabetes mellitus and worsens its vascular complications.

Entity: Congestive heart failure, unspecified
Reason: Diabetes mellitus significantly increases the risk of developing heart failure due to associated coronary artery disease and metabolic changes.

Entity: Idiopathic peripheral autonomic neuropathy, unspecified
Reason: Peripheral and autonomic neuropathy are well-established complications of chronic diabetes mellitus, leading to sensory and autonomic dysfunction.
