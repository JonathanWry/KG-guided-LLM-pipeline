Disease: Pneumonia

Entity: Bronchopneumonia
Reason: Bronchopneumonia is a direct subtype of pneumonia, involving infection and inflammation of the alveoli in the lungs. It is clinically and pathologically equivalent to pneumonia, making it the most closely related feature.
Path (exact (case-insensitive)): bronchopneumonia (node) → disease_disease (edge) → pneumonia (node) → indication (edge) → Amphotericin B (node) → drug_effect (edge) → Pneumonia (node)

Entity: Bronchitis
Reason: Bronchitis and pneumonia are both lower respiratory tract infections with overlapping symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and dyspnea. Bronchitis often precedes pneumonia or coexists with it, especially in high-risk patients.
Path (exact): Bronchitis (node) → phenotype_phenotype (edge) → Respiratory tract infection (node) → phenotype_phenotype (edge) → Pneumonia (node)

Entity: Bronchitis
Reason: This condition can lead to chemical pneumonitis, a non-infectious form of pneumonia caused by inhalation of toxic substances. It shares pathophysiological features with infectious pneumonia, especially regarding lung inflammation.
Path (exact): Bronchitis (node) → phenotype_phenotype (edge) → Respiratory tract infection (node) → phenotype_phenotype (edge) → Pneumonia (node)

Entity: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
Reason: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis impairs alveolar gas exchange and predisposes to secondary infections like pneumonia. The accumulation of surfactant-like material can create an environment conducive to infection.
Path (exact (case-insensitive)): pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (node) → disease_disease (edge) → autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (node) → disease_phenotype_positive (edge) → Pneumonia (node)

Entity: Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis
Reason: Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis is a potential chronic complication following pneumonia, particularly in severe or recurrent cases. It reflects long-term damage due to inflammation of the lung parenchyma.
Path (exact (case-insensitive)): postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis (node) → contraindication (edge) → Busulfan (node) → drug_effect (edge) → Pneumonia (node)
